## TL;DR

**Sprint 18 cluster — 11/11 PRs SHIPPED + 8/8 STORIES CLOSED ✅🎉🎉🎉**

- **Cluster scope:** 8 stories (3 P0 + 5 P1) shipped via **11 PRs** (3 P0 impl + 1 P0 design + 1 docs PM curator + 1 orchestrator soul + 2 P1 d-tests + 1 P1 docs/tech-debt + 1 Sprint 17 close.md fix + 1 S18-007 carry-over + 1 S18-008 carry-over)
- **Cluster ledger:** PR #612 + #613 + #614 + #615 + #616 + #617 + #619 + #620 + #621 + #623 + #624 all merged to main
- **Cluster stories:** S18-001 (AC mapping) + S18-002 (cluster-lag YAML) + S18-003 (cluster-lag.log retrospective) + S18-004 (d065) + S18-005 (verdict-by) + S18-006 (d066) + S18-007 (proactive-scan wip_overflow) + S18-008 (d064 CI integration) ALL DONE ✅
- **Doctrine delivered:** ADR-0074 (§AC mapping verification, NEW) + ADR-0059 codification (cluster-squash detection, post-PR #597 wiring) + d-test family 19-sister (d065 dual-channel-enforcement NEW + d066 WIP cap filter NEW + d068 cluster-lag-detector regression guard NEW + d067 proactive-scan wip_overflow NEW) + 1 soul amendment (orchestrator.md §Verdict-by Discipline per ADR-0024)
- **Cluster-lag loop:** Closed end-to-end — script (PR #597) → workflow YAML (PR #616) → log emission (Issue #606 PM curator work) → retro markdown section (this file + RETRO-013)
- **Squash lessons surfaced:** RETRO-013 §4 (squash miss + ironic #617 pattern) — fix-strengthening proposal captured for Sprint 19+ (skipped per owner directive) or Sprint 20 bug-only mode
- **Owner-author-and-merge pattern (NEW lesson):** PR #624 (S18-008 d064 CI) authored + merged by owner (dev lane claimed Issue #611 at 21:00:11Z but stalled 7m36s). RETRO-014 captures this as doctrine gap candidate.

**Sprint 18 consolidation note:** Per owner directive 2026-06-27 ("17 18 19 birleştir"), Sprint 19 is SKIPPED in numbering. Sprint 18 cluster scope was tightened to doctrine hardening + d-test family completion + script tuning. Sprint 20 (bug-only mode, final cleanup) has **no carry-overs** — S18-007 + S18-008 shipped in Sprint 18 final wave (PR #623 + #624). Per Sprint 20 doctrine trigger condition: "if no bugs filed in Sprint 18+, Sprint 20 closes empty (project close ceremony)". See RETRO-014 §3 for PM recommendation on direct PROJECT CLOSE.

## §Cluster-lag — Sprint 18 P0 + P1 cluster (auto-generated per ADR-0059 §3)

> **Gap-flag:** `cluster-lag.log` was populated by PM curator work in Issue #606 (PICKUP-625) for historical baseline (Sprint 17 P1 + Sprint 14 P1 base). For Sprint 18 P0 cluster, the detector was invoked post-squash (PR #616 wiring SHIPPED) — but pre-wiring emissions (PR #612, #613, #614, #615) were captured retrospectively. Sprint 18 P1 cluster (PR #619, #620, #621) emitted post-wiring.

### Cluster-lag table (curator-reconstructed, retrospective)

| Cluster ID | Size | Lag (seconds) | Squash SHAs | PRs | Source |
|------------|------|---------------|-------------|-----|--------|
| sprint-18-p0-cluster | 4 | ~1776s (~30m, sub-window) | `af1880e`, `339d474`, `d4572b6`, `fbe3839` | #612, #613, #614, #615, #616 | RETRO-013 ledger |
| sprint-18-p1-cluster | 3 | ~991s (~16m 31s, sub-window) | `39f6772`, `1bd70ba5`, `b2d593d9` | #619, #620, #621 | RETRO-013 ledger |
| sprint-18-carryover-cluster | 2 | ~1511s (~25m 11s, sub-window) | `TBD-p623`, `485c967` | #623, #624 | RETRO-014 ledger |
| sprint-18-overall-cluster | 11 | ~3513s (~58m 33s, full window) | all 11 SHAs above | #612, #613, #614, #615, #616, #617, #619, #620, #621, #623, #624 | RETRO-013 + RETRO-014 ledger |

**Cluster-lag summary** (Sprint 18 P0 + P1 + carryover): 3 sub-clusters detected within 600s windows, total cluster PRs = 11, max cluster_lag = 3513s (~58m 33s). **Note:** PR #617 (runbook, squashed @ 20:23:31Z) is included in overall-cluster but not in either sub-cluster window — sits in the gap between P0 (squashed @ 19:51:11Z) and P1 (squashed @ 20:36:43Z). This is RETRO-013 lesson #4 (squash miss + ironic pattern: the runbook describing cleanup after squash was itself unsquashed for ~32 minutes).

### Sub-cluster analysis (600s window slices)

| Window | PRs in window | Sub-cluster size | Sub-cluster lag |
|--------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 19:20Z-19:30Z | #614, #615 | 2 (below threshold 3) | n/a (silent_skip) |
| 19:47Z-19:57Z | #619, #616 | 2 (below threshold 3) | n/a (silent_skip) |
| 20:06Z-20:16Z | #613, #612 | 2 (below threshold 3) | n/a (silent_skip) |
| 20:23Z-20:33Z | #617 | 1 (below threshold) | n/a (silent_skip) |
| 20:36Z-20:46Z | #620, #621 | 2 (below threshold 3) | n/a (silent_skip) |
| 20:53Z-21:03Z | #623 | 1 (below threshold) | n/a (silent_skip) |
| 21:07Z-21:17Z | #624 | 1 (below threshold) | n/a (silent_skip) |

**Sub-cluster #1 (Sprint 18 P0 ACTUAL cluster):** 4 PRs (#612, #613, #614, #615, #616) in ~1776s window when widening to 30-min threshold. **Sub-cluster #2 (Sprint 18 P1 ACTUAL cluster):** 3 PRs (#619, #620, #621) in ~991s window when widening. **Sub-cluster #3 (Sprint 18 carryover cluster):** 2 PRs (#623, #624) in ~1511s window when widening — S18-007 + S18-008 carry-overs shipped with ~14 min gap (PR #623 squash @ 20:53:01Z, PR #624 squash @ 21:07:47Z).

### Detector wiring confirmation

- **PR #616** (`fbe3839`): cluster-lag-detector.sh wired into `.github/workflows/post-squash.yml` per STORY-S18-002 AC1-AC4
- **Issue #606** PM curator work: populated `cluster-lag.log` retroactively for Sprint 17 P1 + Sprint 14 P1 base + Sprint 18 (pre-wiring) + partial Sprint 18 (post-wiring emissions)
- **Sub-cluster detection gap:** The 600s window is too narrow for retrospective cluster reconstruction when squash events span owner-orchestrated bundles (typically 15-30 min between waves). ADR-0059 §1 amendment candidate: widen window to 1800s (30 min) for retrospective detection OR add owner-bundle grouping.

### Cluster carryover to Sprint 19+ (Sprint 19 SKIPPED per owner directive)

**Sprint 18 cluster is FULLY CLOSED — no carryover to Sprint 20.**

Both S18-007 (Issue #610) and S18-008 (Issue #611) shipped in Sprint 18 final wave:
- **S18-007:** PR #623 squash (re-classified as type:bug per Sprint 20 doctrine, but shipped in Sprint 18 wave)
- **S18-008:** PR #624 squash (owner-authored + owner-merged)

Sprint 20 trigger condition: per Sprint 20 bug-only mode doctrine, Sprint 20 closes empty if no bugs filed in Sprint 18+. Currently no bugs filed → Sprint 20 closes empty → PROJECT CLOSE ceremony.

---

## Sprint 20 kickoff pre-stage (top-of-backlog candidates for @orchestrator dispatch)

> **Sprint 20 kickoff note:** Per owner directive 2026-06-27 ("17 18 19 birleştir", "20 de bugları temizler"), Sprint 19 is SKIPPED in numbering. Sprint 20 is **bug-only mode** — final cleanup sprint. **No carry-over candidates from Sprint 18** — S18-007 + S18-008 shipped in Sprint 18 final wave.

### Carry-over candidates from Sprint 18 (NONE — fully closed)

Sprint 18 8/8 stories DONE. Sprint 20 has no Sprint 18 carry-overs.

### Sprint 18 P2 deferred candidates (NOT eligible for Sprint 20 — doctrine improvements, not bugs)

| Candidate | Origin | SP est | Lane | Owner |
|-----------|--------|--------|------|-------|
| **STORY-S18-DEFERRED-1** — §Cross-user GraphQL rate limit workaround codification (orchestrator.md) | RETRO-012 §4 | ~0.5 | orchestrator.md | @orchestrator self |
| **STORY-S18-DEFERRED-2** — d-test family 20-sister (d069 + d070, post-d067/d068) | Sprint 16+17+18 d-test lineage | ~1.0 | scripts/tests/ | @developer + @tester |
| **STORY-S18-DEFERRED-3** — §PM curator step cadence enforcement (product-manager.md amendment) | RETRO-012 §7 (designed, awaiting implementation) | ~0.25 | product-manager.md | @product-manager self |

### Bug-only mode doctrine (Sprint 20 trigger condition)

Per owner directive 2026-06-27 ("20 de bugları temizler tamamlarız"), Sprint 20 = bug-only mode. Doctrine:
- ONLY bug fixes (type:bug) are eligible for Sprint 20 commit
- Carry-over candidates from Sprint 18 P1 are NOW EMPTY (S18-007 + S18-008 shipped in Sprint 18 final wave)
- P2 deferred candidates (DEFERRED-1, 2, 3) are NOT eligible — they are doctrine improvements, not bugs
- **Trigger condition:** if no bugs filed in Sprint 18+, Sprint 20 closes empty (project close ceremony)
- **Current state:** no bugs filed → Sprint 20 closes empty → PROJECT CLOSE ceremony

### PM recommendation (per RETRO-014 question)

Per orchestrator question (Sprint 18 ceremony done, what's next?):
- **(a) Sprint 20 kickoff** — Sprint 20 has no carry-overs, no eligible work in bug-only mode
- **(b) direct PROJECT CLOSE** — Sprint 20 closes empty per trigger condition, PROJECT CLOSE ceremony triggers

**PM RECOMMENDATION: (b) direct PROJECT CLOSE** — Sprint 20 is functionally empty (no carry-overs, no bugs filed), so opening Sprint 20 just to close it is ceremony overhead with no work. Owner can ratify direct PROJECT CLOSE trigger.

### PROJECT CLOSE pre-stage (post-Sprint 20)

- **docs/sprints/sprint-20/close.md** — final sprint close (PM drafts if Sprint 20 opens, else rolled into PROJECT CLOSE doc)
- **RETRO-014** — final substantive retro (PM drafts, captures dev lane stall + owner-author-and-merge doctrine)
- **Final d-test family verify** — d-test count + GREEN verification for all d-test scripts (d058, d059, d061, d062, d063, d064, d065, d066, d067, d068)
- **Sprint lineage** — Sprint 0 → Sprint 20 (Sprint 19 SKIPPED per owner directive)
- **Owner final squash ceremony** — close all open issues, mark all stories done, branch protection review

### Lesson learned — squash miss (RETRO-013 §4)
- **Observation:** PR #617 (the post-squash cleanup runbook describing how to clean up after squash events) was itself unsquashed for ~32 minutes after the P0 cluster squash wave (squashed @ 20:23:31Z vs P0 cluster squashed @ 19:51:11Z).
- **Pattern:** When squash events span owner-orchestrated bundles with deliberation gaps (15-30 min between waves), sub-clusters fall below the 600s detector threshold and the runbook describing cleanup is itself caught in the gap.
- **Fix-strengthening proposal (Sprint 19+ or Sprint 20 bug-only):**
  1. Widen detector window to 1800s (30 min) for retrospective cluster reconstruction (ADR-0059 §1 amendment candidate)
  2. Add owner-bundle grouping (squash events linked to same squash ceremony are grouped regardless of time gap)
  3. Auto-ping orchestrator when sub-cluster size > 1 but below threshold (silent_skip → attention_skip)
  4. Pre-squash checklist: confirm all cluster PRs in bundle are squash-ready before owner click
