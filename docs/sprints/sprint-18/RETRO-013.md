# RETRO-013 — Sprint 18 P0+P1 Cluster Process Gaps (DRAFT, PM lane)

> **Author:** @product-manager (lane: docs/sprints/ per file ownership matrix, curator pattern per ADR-0059 §3)
> **Date:** 2026-06-28T20:42+03:00 = 17:42Z
> **Scope:** Sprint 18 P0 + P1 cluster close process observations + doctrine gaps surfaced
> **Lane:** `docs/sprints/sprint-18/RETRO-013.md` (PM curator lane per file ownership matrix, sister-pattern to RETRO-012)
> **Sister-pattern:** RETRO-012 (Sprint 17 P1 ProcessGap retro, `docs/sprints/sprint-17/RETRO-012.md`, orchestrator lane) + RETRO-011 (Sprint 16 codifications, `docs/retros/retro-011.md`, PM lane)
> **PM curator commitment:** cmt 4826303998 lineage (Issue #584, Option B → ADR-0059 §3)
> **Owner ratification:** Pending (deferred per ADR-0031 owner gating; PM drafts, orchestrator ratifies, owner ratifies scope)
> **Forward-resolution:** This is a process-gap retro for Sprint 18 cluster, NOT a codification retro. Captures Sprint 18 process observations for archival in `docs/sprints/sprint-18/close.md` (PM lane per file ownership matrix, this same PR).

## TL;DR

Sprint 18 cluster (8 stories: 3 P0 + 5 P1) closed via 9-PR parallel-ship pattern. **Process gaps surfaced**:

| # | Gap | Cycle / Origin | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | PM lane discipline drift (cc:product-manager on scripts/ stories in Sprint 18 P1) | PICKUP-627 (lane hygiene cleanup) | P3 | RESOLVED (label hygiene applied, lane definition LOCKED enforced) |
| 2 | Squash miss lesson (PR #617 unsquashed in P0 wave gap, ironic pattern) | PICKUP-628 (orchestrator flag) | P2 | SURFACED — fix-strengthening proposal in §4 |
| 3 | GraphQL rate limit exhaustion (REST API fallback exhausted during Sprint 18 cluster close window) | PICKUP-625 (cluster-lag detector invocation) | P3 | WORKAROUND — REST API + owner web UI path |
| 4 | Squash miss + ironic runbook pattern (PR #617 = post-squash cleanup runbook itself unsquashed) | (NEW, lesson surfaced in §4 below) | P2 | FIX-STRENGTHENING PROPOSAL |
| 5 | Sub-cluster detection gap (600s window too narrow for retrospective reconstruction) | RETRO-013 §Cluster-lag analysis | P3 | AMENDMENT CANDIDATE — ADR-0059 §1 widen window to 1800s |
| 6 | Per-role WIP cap script miscounts (Sprint 17 issue still present in Sprint 18 cluster) | RETRO-012 §6 + Sprint 18 d066 fix | P3 | RESOLVED via d066 d-test (PR #620) |
| 7 | Proactive-scan wip_overflow false positive (AT-CAP vs OVERFLOW) | RETRO-012 §5 | P3 | NOT YET RESOLVED — S18-007 carry to Sprint 20 |
| 8 | PM curator step cadence (cluster-lag.log population + §Cluster-lag markdown section) | RETRO-012 §7 | P2 | RESOLVED — Issue #606 PM curator work + this RETRO + close.md |

**Tier 1 (1 candidate)**: Sprint 18 P0 cluster ProcessGap codification (close.md carrier + ADR-0059 §1 amendment)
**Tier 2 (3 candidates)**: Squad-level process doctrine updates (squash miss fix-strengthening, PM lane discipline enforcement, d-test family completion)
**Tier 3 (4 candidates)**: Script-tuning backlog, owner triage

## Tier 1 — Cluster ProcessGap codification (close.md carrier)

### §1 — ADR-0059 §1 amendment candidate: widen sub-cluster window

**Observed**: Sprint 18 P0 cluster (5 PRs: #612, #613, #614, #615, #616) spanned 30+ minutes due to owner-orchestrated squash waves (PRs squashed in 2-3 min intervals but with 5-15 min deliberation gaps between waves). The 600s sub-cluster detector window (per d064 TC2 fixture codification) classified each wave as silent_skip (sub-cluster size 2 < threshold 3) — but the P0 cluster as a whole is a meaningful unit.

**Pattern**: When owner squash events are grouped by deliberate ceremony (e.g., "squash the P0 cluster"), individual squash events may span 15-30 min but represent a single cluster. The detector misses this because:
- 600s window is too narrow for retrospective reconstruction
- Owner-bundle grouping is not yet captured in the detector metadata
- Sub-clusters of size 2 are silent_skip per ADR-0048 lens d (mandatory log emission on no-cluster) — but they're "real" sub-clusters in the owner-bundle sense

**Codification candidate**: Amend ADR-0059 §1 to widen sub-cluster window from 600s to 1800s (30 min) for retrospective detection. Alternative: add owner-bundle grouping via squash comment metadata.

**Resolution**: PM curator captured this observation in Sprint 18 close.md §Cluster-lag. Filed as RETRO-013 Tier 1 candidate for ADR-0059 §1 amendment. Owner triage in Sprint 19+ (skipped per directive) or Sprint 20 bug-only mode.

### §2 — Squash miss + ironic runbook pattern (LESSON #4)

**Observed**: PR #617 (the post-squash cleanup runbook describing how to clean up after squash events) was itself unsquashed for ~32 minutes after the P0 cluster squash wave (PR #617 squashed @ 20:23:31Z vs P0 cluster squashed @ 19:51:11Z). The runbook describes how to handle exactly the situation it was stuck in — meta-ironic but symptomatic.

**Pattern**: When squash events span owner-orchestrated bundles with deliberation gaps:
1. Owner squashes P0 cluster bundle → cluster-squash detector should fire
2. Detector misses because sub-cluster size 2 < threshold 3 (RETRO-013 §1 amendment candidate above)
3. Runbook describing cleanup procedure is itself in the unsquashed remainder
4. PM/orchestrator can't reference the runbook because it's not on main yet
5. Cures itself when owner eventually squashes the runbook (PR #617 squash @ 20:23:31Z)

**Codification candidate**: Add §Squash-bundle completeness pre-check to `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md`:
- Before orchestrator signals "cluster squash ready", verify ALL PRs in the bundle are squash-ready (no PRs in the bundle with open Refs anchors pointing to stories that need manual close)
- If any PR in the bundle is unsquashed, either (a) defer the cluster squash signal until all are ready, or (b) explicitly call out the unsquashed PR(s) in the runbook pre-state
- This is a forward doctrine that prevents the ironic pattern

**Resolution**: Captured in RETRO-013 §4 below + Sprint 18 close.md §Lesson learned. Filed as P2 candidate for Sprint 19+ (skipped per directive) or Sprint 20 bug-only mode.

## Tier 2 — Squad-level process doctrine updates

### §3 — PM lane discipline drift (cycle from PICKUP-627)

**Observed**: Sprint 18 P1 stories (#609, #610, #611 — scripts/ territory per file ownership matrix) were authored with `cc:product-manager` label. Per PM lane definition LOCKED (Sprint 13+), PM is NOT cc'd on scripts/ refactors — the cc:product-manager was a stale lane discipline violation.

**Pattern**: When Sprint 18 backlog.json was authored (PR #613 squash), the cc labels were set per file ownership matrix for the *primary* lane owner (architect, developer, tester) but PM was cc'd as a "sponsor" pattern. The sponsor pattern is appropriate for arch lane work (PM cross-lane sponsor per ADR-0059 §3 lineage) but NOT appropriate for scripts/ dev lane work.

**Codification candidate**: Add §PM lane cc discipline enforcement to `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md`:
- When PM is the primary lane owner (PM lane territory = docs/product/, docs/backlog/, docs/sprints/ content), `cc:product-manager` is appropriate
- When PM is a cross-lane sponsor (arch lane soul amendments per Issue #430 + #470 lineage), `cc:product-manager` is appropriate
- When PM is NOT lane-relevant (scripts/ refactors, src/ impl, tests/ impl), `cc:product-manager` is FORBIDDEN per Sprint 13+ LOCKED lane definition
- File ownership matrix is the source of truth for PM lane eligibility

**Resolution**: PM applied lane hygiene cleanup in PICKUP-627 (removed cc:product-manager from #609, #610, #611). All 3 audit-commented with cross-ref to file ownership matrix + PM lane LOCKED. Filed as Tier 2 candidate for orchestrator.md amendment.

### §4 — Squash miss + ironic runbook pattern (LESSON #4 continued)

See Tier 1 §2 above. Codification: add §Squash-bundle completeness pre-check to `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md`.

### §5 — Sub-cluster detection gap (cross-ref Tier 1 §1)

See Tier 1 §1 above. Codification: amend ADR-0059 §1 to widen sub-cluster window.

### §6 — d-test family completion (d067 + d068 carry-over)

**Observed**: Sprint 18 added d065 (dual-channel-enforcement, PR #614) + d066 (WIP cap filter, PR #620) to the d-test family (17-sister → 18-sister). PR #616 introduced d068 as part of the cluster-lag YAML wiring scope — d068 is the cluster-lag detector regression guard (sister-pattern to d064 + d065 + d066).

**Pattern**: d-test family grows by 2 per sprint (sister-pattern). Sprint 19+ carry-over candidates:
- d067 (proactive-scan wip_overflow false positive, sister to d066) — RETRO-012 §5 + Sprint 18 P1 #610 carry
- d068 already SHIPPED in PR #616 (cluster-lag detector regression guard)

**Codification candidate**: d-test family 19-sister completion requires d067 + d069 (new for Sprint 19+ carry). P2 deferred from Sprint 18 P2 (DEFERRED-2 candidate). Owner triage in Sprint 20 bug-only mode if any of these are re-classified as bugs.

**Resolution**: d068 SHIPPED in PR #616. d067 carry-over to Sprint 20 (Issue #610 dev lane). d069 depends on Sprint 19+ scope.

## Tier 3 — Script-tuning backlog (owner triage)

### §7 — Proactive-scan wip_overflow false positive (carry-over, not yet resolved)

**Observed** (from RETRO-012 §5): `scripts/proactive-board-scan.sh` flags `wip_overflow` when lane count > N (presumably 2 per ADR-0038 cap). When 2 lanes (dev, PM) are at exactly 2/2 cap, scan fires wip_overflow count:3 — this is the cap, not overflow.

**Resolution**: Update scan logic to flag OVERFLOW (count > cap), not AT-CAP (count == cap). Owner territory — `.github/workflows/` per file ownership matrix requires owner approval.

**Sprint 18 carry**: STORY-S18-007 (Issue #610) covers this fix + d067 d-test. Carry to Sprint 20 bug-only mode (dev lane).

### §8 — d064 CI workflow integration (carry-over, not yet resolved)

**Observed** (from Sprint 18 plan): d064 cluster-lag d-test is not yet CI-integrated. Sister-pattern to d015/d031/d058/d059 CI integration per ADR-0044 (RED-first TDD).

**Resolution**: Integrate `scripts/tests/d064-cluster-lag.sh` into `.github/workflows/d-tests.yml`. Owner territory for workflow YAML approval.

**Sprint 18 carry**: STORY-S18-008 (Issue #611) covers this. Carry to Sprint 20 bug-only mode (dev lane).

### §9 — Per-role WIP cap script miscounts (RESOLVED via d066)

**Observed** (from RETRO-012 §6): `scripts/wip-cap-check.sh` counts ALL `agent:*` issues regardless of `status:*` label. PM at WIP 2/2 cap because of #582 + #583, but both are owner-gated.

**Resolution** (Sprint 18 d066): Updated script to filter `status:in-progress` AND `agent:<role>`. Added `status:blocked` exemption for owner-gated items. d066 d-test (PR #620) verifies correctness.

### §10 — Cross-user GraphQL rate limit workaround (P2 deferred from Sprint 18)

**Observed** (from RETRO-012 §4): gh pr ready + gh pr edit (label mutations) require GraphQL `markPullRequestReadyForReview` mutation. When same user ID (269754789) hits 5000/5000 hourly limit (shared across all agents + owner), gh CLI returns "GraphQL: API rate limit already exceeded". PATCH /pulls/{N} {draft:false} is a no-op for the draft flag.

**Resolution (workaround)**: REST API fallback (works when GraphQL blocked). Owner web UI click for gh pr ready + squash (only path that bypasses rate limit entirely). Sprint 18+ rate limit events: PICKUP-625 (cluster-lag detector invocation triggered REST fallback).

**Codification candidate**: P2 deferred from Sprint 18 (DEFERRED-1). Owner triage in Sprint 19+ (skipped) or Sprint 20 bug-only mode.

### §11 — PM curator step cadence (RESOLVED)

**Observed** (from RETRO-012 §7): PM is curator for cluster-squash retro markdown per ADR-0059 §3 + cmt 4826303998. PM reads `cluster-lag.log` JSON output, generates §Cluster-lag markdown section per cluster-squash event, injects into retro or close.md.

**Resolution (Sprint 18)**: Issue #606 PM curator work fired (PICKUP-625 → PICKUP-626). cluster-lag.log populated retroactively for Sprint 17 P1 + Sprint 14 P1 base + Sprint 18 (pre-wiring) + partial Sprint 18 (post-wiring emissions). This RETRO + close.md carry the curator output. Cadence enforcement remains informal (Sprint 18 P2 DEFERRED-3).

## Forward-resolution

- **Owner ratification**: Pending. Owner reviews RETRO-013 scope + close.md draft, decides whether to ratify as Sprint 18 close input.
- **PM curator activation**: COMPLETE. PM drafted close.md + RETRO-013 per ADR-0059 §3. cluster-lag.log populated via Issue #606.
- **Sprint 18 close.md** (`docs/sprints/sprint-18/close.md`, PM lane, this PR's companion file) is the canonical landing pad for RETRO-013 + PM curator output + cluster-lag observations.
- **Sprint 19+ scope**: SKIPPED per owner directive 2026-06-27. Carry-over candidates (S18-007 + S18-008 + P2 DEFERRED-1/2/3) route to Sprint 20 bug-only mode (or close empty if no bugs filed).
