# scripts/deploy-runner.sh — DEPLOY-001 prod-host runner v9.1 (refs #130, #155, #193,
# ADR-0027, ADR-0027-amend-1 implied by RCA-7 4-layer findings, RCA-9 + RCA-11
# + RCA-12 + RCA-14 fix).
#
# Sprint 3 v5 rewrite per Issue #155 — supersedes PR #151 (e13407d) v4.
# Sprint 3 v6 amend per Issue #160 — supersedes PR #157 v5 for the preflight
# dep install path. v6 is a follow-up bugfix, not a rewrite — restart pattern
# unchanged (RCA-7-1/2/3 fix verified working at PR #157 squash c7c060e).
# Sprint 3 v7 amend per Issue #164 — supersedes v6 for the explicit
# uvicorn+fastapi runtime install path. v7 is a follow-up bugfix, not a
# rewrite — FAIL-or-CREATE preflight pattern unchanged (RCA-9 fix verified
# working at PR #161 squash 73fc618).
# Sprint 3 v8 amend per Issue #168 — supersedes v7 for the cross-user port
# kill failure. v8 is a follow-up bugfix, not a rewrite — restart pattern
# (nohup+setsid) unchanged (RCA-7-1/2/3 fix verified working at PR #157
# squash c7c060e), but the pre-check (port-owner via `ss -tlnp`, exit 5)
# and post-check (port-PID etimes via `ss -tlnp`, exit 6) are now strict.
# Sprint 3 v9 amend per Issue #171 — supersedes v8 for the uvicorn
# orphan-kill bug (runner cleanup phase terminates nohup-spawned uvicorn,
# prod page goes dead between deploys). v9 is a follow-up bugfix, not a
# rewrite — RCA-12 pre/post checks unchanged (verified working at PR #169
# squash 094997e), but the spawn shape is now: `systemctl --user stop`
# → `systemctl --user start atilcalc-web.service` (uvicorn lifecycle owned
# by systemd user-service per ADR-0010). The nohup+setsid pattern is
# REMOVED, not just supplemented. New exit code 7 = systemd integration
# failure (unit not registered, not enabled, or systemctl call failed).
#
# Sprint 6 v9.1 amend per Issue #193 — RCA-17 redesign Option B' (PR #358 MERGED).
# Adds 2-line audit log capturing REPO_DIR + current user identity at deploy
# time. DOC-only amendment, no behavioral change. The audit log answers the
# questions RCA-17 asked: "what path was deploy from?" + "what user ran
# deploy?". REPO_DIR default chain unchanged (canonical path, no symlink).
#
# Why v6: RCA-9 (Issue #160) — first auto-deploy after PR #157 merge FAILED
# at run #27862367000 because the v5 preflight dep install was WARN/SKIP
# when `.venv` was missing (fresh self-hosted runner checkout has no venv).
# The script logged a WARN, then `restart_service()` failed at the
# `.venv/bin/uvicorn not found` check (exit 3). v6 changes this to a
# FAIL/CREATE pattern: missing `.venv` → create via `uv venv`; missing `uv`
# → fail with exit 4; dep install failure → fail with exit 4.
#
# Why v8: RCA-12 (Issue #168) — eighth auto-deploy after PR #165 merge FAILED
# at run #27865086173 because deploy-runner.sh restart_service() called
# `pkill -f 'uvicorn.*atilcalc' 2>/dev/null || true` (silent on cross-user
# no-op) and the post-restart check was `ps aux | grep uvicorn | grep -v grep`
# (matches ANY uvicorn — not port-aware). A pre-existing uvicorn (PID 33353,
# owned by user `atilcan`, started 2026-06-20T05:02 from the manual unblock,
# bound to port 8000) stayed up because the self-hosted runner (user
# `gh-actions-runner`) cannot kill a process owned by a different user
# without sudo. The runner's nohup-spawned uvicorn tried to bind port 8000
# and failed. The lenient post-check returned "running" (atilcan's old
# uvicorn was running, just not the right one). The smoke test curled
# 127.0.0.1:8000 → hit atilcan's uvicorn → git_sha mismatch (got=e13407d9,
# want=540deffe=PR #165 merge) → rollback → exit 1.
#
# v8 implements two defense-in-depth checks:
#   1. **Pre-restart** (before pkill): `ss -tlnp "sport = :$ATC_PORT"` →
#      extract the port-bound PID's uid; if different from current uid,
#      fail-fast with exit 5 (cross-user port conflict). The pre-check
#      MUST appear before pkill in source order so cross-user conflicts
#      surface as a clear error rather than a silent no-op.
#   2. **Post-restart** (replace lenient `ps aux | grep uvicorn`): after
#      a 2s bind-settle, `ss -tlnp "sport = :$ATC_PORT"` → verify the
#      port-bound process started RECENTLY (etimes ≤ 60s). The atilcan
#      uvicorn from the manual unblock has been running for hours
#      (etimes >> 60s); our just-spawned uvicorn has etimes ~2s. If the
#      port-bound process is OLD, fail with exit 6 (port-PID mismatch
#      — cross-user scenario recurring). This is the same family of
#      "lenient silent failure" anti-pattern that motivated the FAIL-or-
#      CREATE fix in v6 (RCA-9); v8 extends the FAIL-or-CREATE doctrine
#      to the restart step.
#
# New exit codes (5 + 6) are the RCA-12 surface; the pre-check + post-check
# pair is defense-in-depth. The pre-check should catch all cross-user
# scenarios at the gate; the post-check is the backstop in case the
# pre-check tool (`ss`) is missing on the host or the port is in a
# transient state at the moment of the check.
#
# Why v7: RCA-11 (Issue #164) — second auto-deploy after PR #161 merge FAILED
# at run #27864083208 because v6's preflight ran `uv pip install -p .venv -e .`
# which only installs RUNTIME deps from pyproject.toml `dependencies = [...]`
# (mpmath==1.3.0). The FastAPI + uvicorn HTTP layer was declared as `[dev]`
# extras, NOT runtime, so it was never installed into `.venv/bin/uvicorn`.
# The script then correctly FAILED at the defense-in-depth restart_service()
# `.venv/bin/uvicorn not found` check (exit 4 — RCA-9 regression prevented),
# but the root cause is a pyproject.toml design gap: HTTP surface is a RUNTIME
# surface, not a dev tool. v7 implements **Option B** (architect's preferred
# Sprint 4 hygiene, now Sprint 3 P0 due to merged test contract AP-23c): adds
# a `web` extra to pyproject.toml (single source of truth for prod runtime
# pins) and switches the preflight to `uv pip install -p .venv -e ".[web]"`.
# The `[dev]` extra retains the dev tooling (pytest, ruff, mypy, playwright)
# plus the package names `fastapi` and `uvicorn[standard]` (UN-pinned; dev
# tooling uses pip's resolver — see AP-23c carve-out rationale in
# docs/test-plans/DEPLOY-001-tests.md).
#
# 4 RCA-7 layers + fixes (v5):
#   RCA-7-1: atilcalc-web.service systemd unit does NOT exist on prod
#     → fix: nohup+setsid canonical restart (systemd detection is now WARN-only)
#   RCA-7-2: symptom of 7-1
#     → fix: same as 7-1
#   RCA-7-3: hallucinated module path atilcalc.web.app:app (atilcalc.web is JS-only)
#     → fix: canonical module is atilcalc.api.main:app (verified 12 references)
#   RCA-7-4: stale .venv lacks runtime deps (mpmath==1.3.0) after git reset
#     → fix: preflight uv pip install -p .venv -e .
#
# RCA-9 layer + fix (v6):
#   RCA-9:  fresh self-hosted runner checkout has NO .venv at all (not just
#           stale deps). v5 preflight was WARN/SKIP when .venv missing →
#           restart_service() failed at the existence check → exit 3.
#     → fix: FAIL-or-CREATE pattern — `uv venv .venv` if missing; fail
#           (exit 4) if uv missing or venv creation fails or `uv pip install`
#           exits non-zero. New exit code 4 = preflight failure.
#
# RCA-12 layer + fix (v8):
#   RCA-12: cross-user process kill silently no-ops. pkill -f ... || true
#           succeeds (returns 0) on cross-user targets, leaving atilcan's
#           pre-existing uvicorn on port 8000. The lenient post-check
#           (ps aux | grep uvicorn) returns "running" for atilcan's uvicorn
#           (matches ANY uvicorn), so the smoke test curls 127.0.0.1:8000,
#           hits the wrong uvicorn, sees old git_sha, fails, rolls back.
#     → fix: pre-restart `ss -tlnp` port-owner check (exit 5 on cross-user)
#           + post-restart `ss -tlnp` etimes check (exit 6 on stale port).
#           The pre-check is the gate; the post-check is defense-in-depth.
#           Both use `ss -tlnp` (port-aware) — NOT the lenient ps grep.
#
# RCA-11 layer + fix (v7):
#   RCA-11: pyproject.toml declared fastapi+uvicorn as [dev] extras, not
#           runtime deps. `uv pip install -e .` only installs the runtime
#           list → .venv/bin/uvicorn never created → defense-in-depth
#           restart_service() check fires (exit 4). v6 fix verified working
#           (correct failure mode, no silent WARN), but RCA-11 reveals the
#           underlying design gap.
#     → fix: **Option B** — add a `web` extra to pyproject.toml (single
#           source of truth for prod runtime pins — see pyproject.toml
#           [project.optional-dependencies] web), then switch
#           deploy-runner.sh to `uv pip install -p .venv -e ".[web]"`.
#           The `[dev]` extra retains pytest/ruff/mypy/playwright + the
#           un-pinned package names `fastapi` and `uvicorn[standard]`
#           for dev tooling (TestClient, httpx test backend). Fail
#           (exit 4) on install failure (parity with RCA-7-4 + RCA-9
#           pattern). Satisfies merged test contract AP-23c "exactly
#           one place" probe — pins live in pyproject [web] only, NOT
#           duplicated in this script.
#
# Canonical restart pattern (RCA-14 / Issue #171 — REPLACED v8's nohup+setsid):
#   # Pre-deploy: stop the service (clean shutdown under systemd)
#   systemctl --user stop atilcalc-web.service
#   # Post-deploy: start the service (uvicorn lifecycle now owned by systemd)
#   systemctl --user start atilcalc-web.service
#   # The unit's ExecStart spawns uvicorn. Restart-on-fail via Restart=always
#   # in the unit file. Logout-survivable via `loginctl enable-linger atilcan`
#   # (owner pre-req, one-time setup on prod host).
#   # Per ADR-0010 (systemd user-service contract).
#
# Sprint 3 P0 trade-off (now resolved by v9):
#   For Sprint 3 P0 unblock we used the nohup+setsid canonical restart
#   (RCA-7-1/2/3 fix at PR #157, verified at PR #169 RCA-12 v8 amend).
#   This worked for the deploy smoke test (DoD §4 = 3/3 PASS) but the
#   self-hosted runner's "Cleanup orphan processes" step at job end
#   terminates the nohup-spawned uvicorn: "Complete job Terminate
#   orphan process: pid (47805) (uvicorn)". So between deploys, no
#   uvicorn is listening on port 8000. v9 REPLACES this with the
#   systemd user-service integration (ADR-0010), so the service
#   outlives the runner job.
#
# Owner pre-req (one-time, on prod host, BEFORE first v9 deploy):
#   1. Install the atilcalc-web.service unit (path:
#      /home/atilcan/.config/systemd/user/atilcalc-web.service) — see
#      Issue #171 body for unit content.
#   2. `loginctl enable-linger atilcan` — so the service survives logout.
#   3. `systemctl --user daemon-reload` (after unit install).
#   4. `systemctl --user enable atilcalc-web.service` — autostart on login.
#
# Invoked on the prod host by .github/workflows/deploy.yml via the
# self-hosted runner (Issue #143 in flight) or, as fallback, via
# appleboy/ssh-action with the same script (per ADR-0027 §Decision.2).
#
# Responsibilities per ADR-0027 §Decision.3 (smoke test) + §Decision.5 (idempotency):
#   1. git fetch + reset --hard origin/main             (idempotent converge)
#   2. Preflight: uv venv .venv (if missing) + uv pip install -e ".[web]"
#      (RCA-7-4 + RCA-9 + RCA-11 — [web] extra is single source of truth)
#   3. Preflight: detect atilcalc-web.service (FAIL or — owner pre-req not met)
#      (RCA-14: systemd unit must be registered; exit 7 if not)
#   4. Restart via systemctl --user (stop + start)      (ADR-0010, RCA-14 v9)
#   5. GET /healthz smoke test                          (DEPLOY-003 contract)
#   6. On smoke-test failure: rollback + retry once     (HEAD@{1} revert)

#   2  — smoke test failed AND rollback failed; owner paged, manual fix needed
#   3  — usage / configuration error (missing GITHUB_SHA, bad REPO_DIR, etc.)
#   4  — preflight failure (RCA-9: uv missing, venv creation failed, or
#        `uv pip install -e ".[web]"` failed; RCA-11: [web] extra missing
#        or broken; owner must intervene manually)
#   exit code 5 — cross-user port conflict (RCA-12: port $ATC_PORT is bound
#        by a process owned by a different user; runner cannot kill it
#        without sudo. Fix: run runner as the prod user, sudoers rule, or
#        change $ATC_PORT to a non-conflicting port. Owner must intervene.)
#   exit code 6 — post-restart port-PID mismatch (RCA-12: post-restart
#        ss -tlnp shows the port is bound by a process with etimes > 60s
#        — a pre-existing uvicorn, not our just-spawned one. The pre-check
#        should have caught this with exit 5; investigate tool/sudo chain.)
#   exit code 7 — systemd integration failure (RCA-14 / Issue #171:
#        atilcalc-web.service unit is not registered, or `systemctl --user`
#        call returns non-zero. The v9 fix requires systemd user-service
#        (ADR-0010); the nohup+setsid canonical pattern was REMOVED in v9
#        because the runner cleanup phase terminates it. Owner pre-req:
